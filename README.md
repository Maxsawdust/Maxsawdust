## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

I'm Max, a software developer based in Surrey, England.
I specialise in full stack web development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and node!

I come from a creative background in music, so I'm always applying an out-of-the-box thinking strategy to my code.

## What I'm up to:

- ðŸŒ± Currently I'm still fleshing out my knowledge through my bootcamp with Imperial College London and HyperionDev!
  I started this course in December, and I'm scheduled to finish in May.
  I've covered everything from web development fundamentals, to front-end development with React so far, and I'm quickly approaching modules on back-end development.
  I pride myself in that I've got a 100% grade on this course so far. I'm trying my hardest to keep this up, all while trying to learn about topics not covered within the course as well.

- ðŸ”­  My current project is an online store application meant to expand my knowledge on React Routing and form validation with Formik and Yup.
  This project can be found here: https://github.com/Maxsawdust/rr-online-store
  I've also been delving into writing simulations in JavaScript, and I've started to create a boids simulation here: https://github.com/Maxsawdust/boid-project.
